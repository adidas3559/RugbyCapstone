 	            We currently play in the Memorial Stadium on the Kansas State University campus. 
                The pitch is located adjacent to the Alumni Center at the intersection of Anderson Avenue and 17th Street. 
                Parking is available on the west side of the stadium, just off of Denison Avenue. 
                Post match socials are generally held at the southeast corner of Harris Avenue. and Hunting Avenue, just a couple of blocks west of the stadium.
